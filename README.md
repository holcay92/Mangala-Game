• Write the program in Java

• You don’t need to implement a GUI. However, you need to display the current
game status after each move. You can use console for getting input and printing
the board status.

Your program will end execution when one of the players has no stones in her holes.
This player will put the stones in the holes of the opponent to her box.

The winner will
be the one who has more number of stones in her own box at the end of the game.
